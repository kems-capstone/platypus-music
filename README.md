# PLATYPUS:

• A responsive web application allowing users to collaborate on a playlist!

• Hosts can create a private room accessible only by typing in the room's associated secret room key, where they and their guests can add and vote on songs on a collective playlist. The playlist automatically re-orders, ensuring the crowd favorite always plays next.
